### Project Overview
This project's goal was the development of video conferencing software for a minimum of six users. After discussing the requirements as a team, we agreed to implement and deploy an intuitive web-based application enabling up to six participants to communicate with both video and audio. We have named the resulting product <b>Groups</b>. The current version of Groups is deployed and accessible <a href="https://groups.kozarkovi.cz/">here</a>.

To achieve this, we leveraged Bootstrap, a frontend toolkit that provides a simple foundation for a responsive website. This approach ensures that Groups is easy to use on any computer and remains accessible on the go via a phone or tablet. NGINX handles website hosting, while FFmpeg and Node.js are used for content processing and the website backend, respectively. 


## Website frontend
As mentioned in the project overview the websites responsive design is achieved mainly by using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> fronend toolkit. It enables automatic adjustment of the website layout based on the device screen size. This ensures that users have a consistent and user-friendly experience whether they access the site from a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. Specifically, the website uses Bootstrap´s collumn system, navigation bar components, collapsible elements, colors and button styles. A good example of theese elements can be found on the main meeting page on the website, which is also show in the image below.
